# My Algorithm Learning Journey
## Princeton Algorithms Course on Coursera

### Why I Chose This Course
I decided to dive into algorithms and data structures to strengthen my computer science fundamentals. Princeton's course stood out because:
- It offers a perfect balance of theory and practical implementation
- The instructors (Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne) are renowned in the field
- The programming assignments provide real-world context
- The visual teaching aids help cement complex concepts

### Personal Learning Goals
1. Build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking
2. Improve problem-solving capabilities
3. Prepare for technical interviews
4. Understand the mathematics behind efficient programming
5. Learn to write more optimized code
